# A rather simple and naive solution to SSH Keys

## Introduction

This is a WIP - it is intended as a vehicle to demonstrate a few approaches that I take when solving problems. 

## Disclaimer
Yes I know and am aware there are no tests around this stuff - Ideally I would refine the stories out to ATDD style Acceptance Criterias and test out using Yadda - given timeframes however - I am hot coding. I want to continue this project as it could help a lot of people manage critical parts of their infrastructure. 

For now its a scratch pad!
